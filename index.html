            <h1>Description:</h1>
            <p>The HERA Moonscape Rover will be a set of four rover designed to accomplish separate tasks. One will hold cubes carrying ArduSat and CubeSat payloads. Another will pick up and move the cubes using an arm. One will be a support robot, especially designed to assist the other three rover. Finally, one will use Bluetooth and cameras to capture and log video surveillance</p>

            <h1>Problem Statement:</h1>
            <p>NASA requires four remotely operated specialized rovers. They need to be able to traverse Mars terrain, with one being able to carry a payload, one being able to lift objects with an arm, one being able to record videos and store data, and a final robot being able to support the others</p>
            <h2>Criteria & Constraints:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Base Landscape Design</li>

                    <li>Easily assemblable and disassemblable</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h2>Specific Rovers:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Transportation</li>
                <ul>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h1>User Personas:</h1>
            <p>The robots need to have simple controls and be able to easily adjust to different terrain because the people using it might not have instant communication with it. This means it has to be able to receive an instruction and complete a set of actions based on that instruction, rather than one at a time</p>
            <p>They also need to be easily collapsable as the people collapsing them might be inhibited by thick EVA gloves.</p>

            <h1>3D Model</h1>
            <img src = images/solid_works_model.png>
            <p>PLACEHOLDERTEXT: Our current design consists of a rocker-bogie suspension system attached to a hollow main body. The body's only purpose is to hold the electronics, hence why it's so simple. The wheels will be Grouser Wheels</p>
            <img src = images/printed_model.png>
            <p>PLACEHOLDERTEXT: We 3D printed our design, although we don't have wheels at the moment, meaning we're missing that component, and the model hasn't been made to fit the electronics quite yet. However, it does provide a good basis for our project moving forward</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Electronics</h1>
            <p>Our current design utilizes an Arduino for controlling the rover prototype, as well as Arduino parts. This includes servos for turning the front wheels, as well as DC motors for spinning the wheels</p>
            <p>Our landscape isn't fully completed, but we do have a concept model that uses an Arduino Nano, LEDs, and a button to demonstrate the various types of lighting that our landscape will have and how it would switch between the different lights</p>
            <img src = images/lights.png>
            <p>This image shows our demonstration model for the lighting of the landscape. It includes three LEDs (one red, one green, and one blue), that turn on in various combinations that cycle when you press the button. Although this isn't the exact way that the actual lighting system would be, it serves as a demonstration of an idea of how the final lighting system would function</p>
